    "text": "The availability of healthcare facilities, such as hospitals, is essential to guarantee equal access to medical services for all individuals, irrespective of their socio-economic status or geographical location. In South Korea, there is mounting evidence that suggests the presence of inequalities in access to hospitals or clinics, with certain populations and regions facing greater challenges in obtaining necessary healthcare services. The primary objective of this study is to identify the regions in South Korea that have limited access to hospitals. Our analysis of spatial data has allowed us to detect patterns and trends in hospital and clinic accessibility. We have come out with a user-friendly application designed to bridge the gap between geospatial analysis and ease of use.\nThe platform is specifically tailored to support non-technical users with a particular type of geospatial analysis called Point Pattern Analysis. Our application offers support for two types of Point Pattern Analysis: Spatial Point Patterns Analysis and Network-Constrained Point Patterns Analysis.\nSpatial Point Patterns Analysis helps users determine whether the point distribution in their dataset resembles spatial randomness or exhibits a regular or clustered pattern. It can also identify dependencies between two input dataset point distributions.\nCo-location Analysis helps users determine the spatial relationship between the location of 2 variables and assess their spatial dependence.\nNetwork-Constrained Point Patterns Analysis helps users identify whether the distribution of spatial point events occurring on or alongside networks shows spatial randomness or a regular/clustered pattern."

    "text": "6.1 Methods 1 - Spatial Point Patterns\n\n6.1.1 First-Spatial Point Analysis\nGiven a kernel, a smaller bandwidth tends to lead to an undersmoothed density estimate that may contain many spurious noises (i.e., peaks and valleys), and a larger bandwidth tends to result in an oversmoothed density estimate that may hide some interesting underlying structure. Therefore, choosing an optimal bandwidth for a dataset is important.\nBased on the results, we have decided to choose bw.ppl because it seems to be the most optimal among the rest of the bandwidth. We will also use gaussian in this project because it is most recommended among others.\nWith the kernel density map, denser areas with a heavier distribution of clinics and hospital are easily spotted.\nWe can see from application that gangnam-gu is heavily concentrated for clinics whereas for hospital, we can see that there are 2 areas that is highly concentrated, Jung-gu and yeongdeungpo-gu.\nThis is because the kernel density z-estimate helps to smooth out the points in a given area - a much larger ‘smoothing effect’ than point density, which in turn is helped by the visualisation that kernel density maps have: its range for distributions concentrations is clearly indicated by the gradient of colour - in my case, ranging from yellow to brown for the different bands. Compare this against the individual points in a point map (on the left), which at most shows concentration of certain areas, but makes it hard for the viewer to comprehensively compare the distributions of different regions.\n\n\n6.1.2 Second-Point Pattern Analysis\nIn this application, we have used K and L function.\nK function is a statistical method used to test for clustering or dispersion of points in a spatial region. It compares the observed distribution of points to a null model of complete spatial randomness.\nWe have run the 39 number trials (nsim) in the code chunk and based on the results we have observed that K(r) is far above the K(theo) as well as the envelope - indicating that clinics in Seoul area are very clustered as compared to hospital. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis that both clinic and hospital in Seoul area are randomly distributed at 95% confident interval\nL function is another statistical method used to test for clustering or dispersion of points in a spatial region. It measures the expected number of points within a certain distance of each other and compares it to a null model of complete spatial randomness.\nIf the black line representing the observed L-function is above the envelope, it suggests that the point pattern exhibits clustering. In other words, the observed number of points within a certain distance of each other is higher than what we would expect if the points were randomly distributed in the region. Based on the results, for Hospital at Seoul is shown to be more than 0, but lies within the randomization envelope for distances above 5km. This shows that there is no statistically significant clustering and is randomly distributed at distances above 5km."

In this case, point-based approach is used. For points marked with the value 1 (in yellow), it indicates that there is a hospital/clinic as a nearest neighbour. Those with no access or low access to clinics/hospitals, the points are displayed in pink.\nLCLQ also adopts distance ranks adaptive bandwidth, and ensures that exactly the same number of points is involved in the estimation of LCLQ at each marked point, returning more robust and reliable results.\nGiven the high rate of healthcare needed for the Korean populations, accessibility to hospitals and clinics are vital especially during needs of emergencies. Hence, with this colocation analysis, residents will be able to add this consideration before deciding their area of residence. In contrast, staying within the vicinity of hospitals and clinics can have cons as well, such as having heavier traffic and presence of higher noise levels. For infectious diseases, the chances of spreading will be higher. However, if benefits outweigh cons, it will still be more ideal to have better access to medical facilities."

    "text": "6.3 Methods 3 - Network Constrained Spatial Point Analysis\nTo illustrate this method, we decided to narrow down to the Gu level. We used Gangnam-Gu as our study area in this research paper.\n\n6.3.1 Network Kernal Density Estimate Visualization\nIn calculating the kernel density, we used the “simple” method to calculate the network kernal density estimate.\n\nThe interactive map above effectively reveals road segments (darker color) with relatively higher density of hospitals than road segments with relatively lower density of hospitals (lighter color).\n\n\n6.3.2 Network Constrained K-Function Analysis\nNull hypothesis:\nThe observed spatial point events (i.e distribution of hospitals) are uniformly distributed over a street network in Gangnam-Gu Area.\n\nThe blue line is the empirical network K-function of the hospital points in Gangnam-Gu. The gray envelop represents the results of the 50 simulations in the interval 2.5% - 97.5%. We notice that the blue line is within the gray envelope suggesting that the observed spatial point events (distribution of hospitals) are uniformly distributed over a street network in Gangnam-Gu Area.\n\n\n6.3.3 Network Constrained K-Cross Function Analysis\nNull Hypothesis: The two types of points resemble random distribution and are independent of each other.\nSeeing that there are only a few hospital within Gangnam-Gu, the K-cross function results is to be expected and as such, the K-cross function helps to identify variables that may be related to the hospital locations. For example, we used residential points so as to see whether residents in Gangnam-Gu are clustered near the hospital points. This helps us identify whether there is spatial dependence between hospitals and residence.\n\nFrom the plot above, we see that from 0 to 750 and 950 to 1200, we cannot reject the null hypothesis and thus the two types of points are independent from each other. However, 750 to 950 and 1200 and above, we can reject the null hypothesis and as it is below the grey envelope, we can conclude that the two types of points resemble repulsion patterns, suggesting dispersion.\nIf the observed K is outside the grey envelope, we can reject the null hypothesis.\nIf the observed K is above, we can conclude the two types of points resemble attraction patterns, suggesting clustering.\nIf it is below, we can conclude the two types of points resemble random distribution and are independent from each other."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe accessibility of healthcare facilities like hospitals are crucial to ensure the equal access of medical services to all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic background or geographical location. In South Korea, recent evidence suggests that there may be disparities in access to hospitals, with certain populations and regions experiencing higher difficulties in obtaining necessary healthcare services. This study aims to find out the regions with limited access to hospitals in South Korea. By analyzing the spatial data, we seek to identify patterns and trends in hospital accessibility. Our findings will provide valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders to address this pressing issue and improve the overall quality of healthcare in South Korea. \n\n\nProject Statement\nDespite the advancements in South Korea’s healthcare system, a significant proportion of the population may still experience challenges in accessing hospitals and receiving timely medical care. Limited accessibility to hospitals can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, exacerbate health disparities among socio-economic groups, and negatively impact the overall health outcomes of the population. The factors contributing to this issue may include uneven distribution of healthcare facilities, inadequate public transportation networks, and socio-economic barriers. We will be analyzing the gaps in the location of the healthcare facilities to see if South Korean residents living in Seoul have adequate accessibility to healthcare services.  \n\n\nProjects Objective\nThe objective of this project is to allow the end-user to use our model to identify areas with low healthcare accessibility.  This app will also show the difference between the conventional and Network Constrained Spatial Point Analysis. Hence, the app will not only provide insights into healthcare accessibility but also serve as an educational tool on the different types of Spatial Point analysis. \nApp Functions: \n\nSpatial Point Pattern Analysis\n\nVisualisation of variable points \nKernel Density Plots \nK, L Function plots and analysis \n\n\n\n\nCo-Location Analysis\n\nVisualisation of Local Co-Location Points \nCo-Location Statistical interpretation \n\n\n\n\nNetwork Constrained Spatial Point Analysis\n\nVisualisation of points and network \nVisualisation of NetKDE \nNetwork Constrained K-Function Analysis \n\n\nThe application will provide 3 levels of analysis, spatial points analysis, network constrained Spatial Point Pattern Analysis and Co-location analysis. The first analysis will showcase the conventional spatial point pattern analysis and draw insights from the findings. The second analysis will showcase the network constrained Spatial point pattern analysis and lastly co-location analysis can help us to understand the spatial patterns of hospitals in Seoul and identify areas where they may be gaps in healthcare service provision. \nBy using South Korea and Seoul in particular, we hope to showcase how our app operates such that our model can be applied to your selected country.  \n\n\nData\n\nSouth Korea level-three administrative boundaries  \nPopulation data  \nHospital / Clinics  \nRoad network \n\nThe purpose of this review aims to explore the potential of Spatial Point Pattern Analysis for understanding the spatial patterns of how healthcare facilities are placed in South Korea with respect to their accessibilities.  \nSeveral Korean researchers analyzed the accessibility of welfare facilities in Daejeon in consideration of their public transport network. In their research, several tools were used such as thematic maps that illustrated bus stop location, bus networks, train networks. They have also calculated distance and time to measure spatial accessibility and visualized their findings. Overall, the study found that improving public transport accessibility would increase spatial equity of welfare services for the residence. \nWith many countries experiencing an aging population, it is important that such facilities remain accessible to all. Hence, we can apply Spatial Point Pattern Analysis to analyze the spatial patterns of healthcare facilities in consideration of their accessibility. This is to understand the problem statement better and suggest recommendations. \n\n\nMethology\n\nSpatial point patterns analysis (SPPA) \n\n1st Order \n2nd Order \n\n\n\n\nNetwork Constraint Spatial Analysis \n\n\n\nCo-location Analysis \n\nThis project examines the accessibility of residents in Seoul Sub district to healthcare facilities.  We collected data including geospatial forms, location, routes, and population in sub district of Seoul. By using spatial point pattern analysis would help us to identify any patterns or clusters in the distribution of hospital in the city. We would explore the use of K, G and L functions to measure the degree of clustering in the hospital location. From the results of this, we could suggest certain areas of the district if it is underserved or overserved by healthcare facilities. \nNext, we will be using Network constrained spatial point pattern analysis to further analyze spatial point events that occur on the network. We can also identify the hotspot or the clusters of it. The function we will be exploring would be NetKDE, it combines kernel density estimation with network distance metrics to estimate the intensity of point events or objects along the network. It takes into account the distance and connectivity between different points on a network when analyzing spatial patterns. If there are areas of the area with low hospital/clinic accessibility, this could suggest that additional healthcare facilities are needed in those areas to improve access to medical care. \nLastly, co-location analysis is a technique used to analyze the spatial relationship between different features in a particular area. It can be used to determine the proximity and clustering pattern of hospitals/clinics in different areas. We can find out the nearest neighboring between each point of interest that we want to find out. Next, we can show areas of high and low hospital density by using heatmaps. This can help to identify areas if are more or fewer hospitals/clinics and can have a better planning decision in the future.  \n\n\nTimeline"
